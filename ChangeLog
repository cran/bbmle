0.2: added parnames, parnames<-
minor fix to allow "profiles" of 1-parameter models
  (skip fdHess call)
minor change to print method for mle results
tweaking "vecpar" (to allow parameter vectors in objective function)
removed fdHess/nlme dependency

0.3: enhanced anova method, works with print.anova
tweaked namedrop() code -- ??

0.4 change AIC to AICc for corrections
    add AICtab for weights, delta, sort ... options

    expose error messages occuring within profile()
    uniroot tries harder to find a valid endpoint
    truncate terms in anova.mle at 80 characters

0.5 fix AICc bug!  (was deviance+2*k*(k+1)/(n-k-1), not AIC+2*k*(k+1)/(n-k-1)

0.6 add experimental formula interface
    change all names from mle to mle2 to avoid confusion/conflicts
       with stats4 version of mle
    change internal structure of data evaluation
    worked on vignette
    added optimizer slot (stub)

0.7 better df extraction in ICtab
    minor bug fix for AICc (allows AICc of nls objects)
    handle models with -1 in formula better:
	starting values set "all equal"
    made ANOVA formula line-length accessible
    added skip.hessian and trace arguments to mle2
    messed around with BIC definition -- attempt at consistency with nlme
    added rudimentary support for nlminb, constrOptim
    nlme now required for fdHess (which is required for
	nlminb since it doesn't compute a finite-diff
	Hessian)

0.7.5 change "ll" to "LL" in examples for clarity
    tweaked anova reporting of models (wrap instead of truncating)
    added (undocumented) show.points option to profile plot
	to display actual locations of profile evaluation
    tweaked profile to behave better when profiling variables
	with constraints (upper, lower)
    moved vignette to inst/doc where it belongs
    ICtab hack to protect against package:aod definition of AIC(logLik)
    added submit stub
    tweaked slice.mle2-class docs for consistency
    fiddled with vignette
    preliminary code to allow non-monotonic profiles
    preliminary add nlm to list of optimizers (untested)
    add aod, Hmisc, emdbook to VignetteDepends and Suggests:

0.7.6 tweak vignette
    fixed second major AICc bug (was fixed in mle2 method,
	 but not in logLik method)

0.7.7 fix bug in profiling: all optim() methods EXCEPT L-BFGS-B
     return the value of the objective function if given a function
     with no arguments/zero-length starting parameter vector
     (this is the situation with "profiling" a 1-D function).
     L-BFGS-B gives funky answers.  added a check for this case.
     (may need to check behavior for alternate optimizers (nlm etc))
    [this behavior triggered a "found better fit" error when profiling
     1D functions with L-BFGS-B]

     changed behavior when finding better fit during profiling
     to return new parameters
